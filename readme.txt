This repository collects all my implementations on generic local network identifiability.
See [my website](https://perso.uclouvain.be/antoine.legat/) for more info on my work, and the articles related to this repository.

- **algebraic_identifiability_test**
contains the codes for our algebraic test of generic local identifiability.

- **gap_global_local**
includes implementations searching for a network that would be generically locally identifiable, but not generically globally identifiable. No such counterexample is known to us to this day.

- **dataset**
collects the codes to generate our dataset of networks of various sizes and topologies.

- **algos_signal_selection**
contains the implementations of our algorithms for signal selection, as well as a script to compare their performances on the dataset.
