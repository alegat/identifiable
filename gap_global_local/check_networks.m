% Exhaustive search of all networks with L nodes, nb_modules modules and all
% patterns of excitations and measurements such that :
%           nb_modules = nb_excitations * nb_measurements,
% except the fully excited or measured ones.
% We also ignore the disconnected graphs since they can be checked by
% their respective connected components.
%
% For each network, we compute generic local identifiability. If it is 
% generically locally identifiable, we check genericglobal identifiability 
% using the function solve.
%
% S.conditions is a vector of conditions for each solution of S. The
% condition themselves do not matter (sometimes, they are just 'symtrue'),
% but S.conditions gives the number of different discrete solution.
%
% For example, when solving x^2 == 4, S.x is length 2 : [-2, +2].
% S.conditions is also length 2 : [symtrue, symtrue].
% In this example, we could take either length(S.x) or length(S.conditions)
% to detect that we have 2 discrete solutions.
%
% In our case though, we do not know the name of the variables since it
% depends on the topology. But we know that there will always be a condition
% for each discrete solution.
% So length(S.conditions) > 1 is our detection criterion for several
% solutions "discretely" separated.
%
% Typical solution :
% S =  
%           G2_1: z1
%           G3_1: z
%           G3_2: z2
%           G2_3: z3
%        Gbis2_1: z1
%        Gbis3_1: z
%        Gbis3_2: z2
%        Gbis2_3: z3
%     parameters: [z    z1    z2    z3]
%     conditions: z2^2*z3^2 + 1 ~= 2*z2*z3 & z ~= 0 & z1 ~= 0 & z2 â€¦
%
% S.conditions actually gives the lower-dimensional set on which global
% identifiability does not hold.
%
% We have a potential counter-example if :
% - length(S.conditions) > 1 : we have several solutions "discretely"
% separated
% - length(S.parameters) > nb_modules : the solution space has a larger
% dimension than the number of unknowns. Normally it should then not be
% locally identifiable so this case should not arise.
%
% If there is a counter-example, we expect that it will be with
% length(S.parameters) = nb_modules, and it would take the following format
% (e.g. nb_modules = 2) :
% Solution 1 : G = (z, z1), Gbis = (z, z1)
% Solution 2 : G = (z, z1), Gbis = (f(z,z1), g(z,z1))
%                      e.g. Gbis = (2*z + z1, z^2 * z1)
%
% When there is a self-loop in the network we sometimes find a second
% solution which is a particular case of the first one. We don't know why
% this happens but this raises "false" counterexamples. Example of
% solutions we get :
% Solution 1 : G = Gbis = (z, z1)
% Solution 2 : G = Gbis = (z, 1)
% Or 
% Solution 1 : G = Gbis = (z, z1)
% Solution 2 : G = Gbis = (z, 2*z)
% Hence we also exclude self-loops from our search
%
% Graph prompts :
% If L = nb_modules + 1 : Only trees. I would be surprised that a counterex
% arises in a tree topology
% If L > nb_modules + 1 : Disconnected graph. Not interesting to check since
% it can be checked by each of its subnetworks
%
% OUTPUTS :
% check_networks(4,4) : 15 660 networks checked, 1 min elapsed
% check_networks(5,4) : 352 800 networks checked, 6 min elapsed
% nb_modules = 5: either nB=5 and nC=1, or the converse, since nB*nC=nb_modules
% check_networks(< 5,5) : Not possible
% check_networks(5,5) : Would be either full excitation or full measurement
% check_networks(6,5) : 2 488 320 networks checked, 1h37 elapsed
% Still no counter-example found
% check_networks(> 6,5) : Not connected
%
% ===> All networks with <= 5 unknown modules have been checked (except with
% self-loops or nb_modules != nB * nC), and no counter-example has been found
%
% I advise to not go with more modules, it will be untractable
